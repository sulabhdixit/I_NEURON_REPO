Project name: Banking Application in Java (Console Based Application)

The project I have created is a Banking Application in Java which is a console-based application. The interface is a user-friendly interface and it's very easy to use.

The MINI Bank interface provides the following services: - 
1) Verification 
2) Balance Check 
3) Deposit Amount
4) Withdraw 
5) Transfer Money
6) Exit 

The User will get a user id and password after successful account creation at the bank. After entering the correct user id the user is prompted to “Enter Password” section. Here the user will enter the password and then only all the services are available to user. After performing all the required services by the user, they can quit the application by Exit option. The app is focusing on security and user experience.
